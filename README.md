## About The Project

A tilebased game in progress. Idea is inspired by roguelike games such as ADOM but more than anything the project is about figuring out how to make a game with React, not so much about making a good game.

### List Of Features

* Tilebased movement
* Following, clamped camera
* Pathfinding
* Zones created from JSON data
* Tiles are placed by predefined mapping or randomly generated

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org)

## Major Components

### Game Manager

Handles stuff!

## Usage

### Movement

Character can be moved with either clicking on the map or **_WASD_**, **_arrow keys_** or **_numpad_**(1, 3, 7 and 9 for diagonal movement.

### Attacking

Enemies can be attacked by walking towards them or clicking them when standing on a nearby tile.

### Interaction

Interaction happens with **_E_**-key. So far the only interactable object is the portal to change zone.

## Roadmap

Quite a bit of work to do for the "engine" before an actual game can be made. Some ideas in an order of rough importance:

* Pop-up messages to show relevant tips for player, for example prompt to press a button to perform certain action like changing zone.
* Major refactoring of map generating to allow for different types of maps like dungeons, outdoors and what not.
* Saving the current game state to local storage and perhaps to cloud too.
* A quest system with quest givers, objectives and log.
* Experience system and more advanced character stats.
* System for items and gear.
* Field of vision with fog of war.
