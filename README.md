## About The Project

A tilebased game in progress. Idea is inspired by roguelike games such as ADOM but more than anything the project is about figuring out how to make a game with React, not so much about making a good game.

### List Of Features

* Tilebased movement
* Following, clamped camera
* Pathfinding
* Zones created from JSON data
* Tiles are placed by predefined mapping or randomly generated

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org)

## Major Components

### Redux State

The store consists of several slices of varying sizes:
* Game reducer keeps track of general game wide information such as player, zones that have been visited and saving and loading zones.
* Zone reducer manages the currently active zone like tiles, objects and creatures and any changes to them such as movement or damage.
* Turn reducer manages the turn system of currently active zone. Once player(and possibly followers if/when they are added) has acted, turn is passed to the next       faction and its creatures take their turn one by one.
* Combat log reducer stores all relevant information about combat and such.
* Camera position reducer is responsible for... the position of camera!

### Game Manager

When zone changes in the game reducer, game manager initializes a new map for the zone reducer.

### Map Manager

Map manager listens to changes to the current zone name and once it changes, information is passed to map loader letting it know a new map should be created. The map loader checks if the zone has already been visited and loads those tiles to the current zone state. In the case of previously unvisited zone, data is loaded from JSON and map generated based on either predefined mapping or randomly generated from definitions.

## Usage

### Movement

Character can be moved by either _clicking_ on the map or using _WASD_, _arrow keys_ or _numpad_(1, 3, 7 and 9 for diagonal movement).

### Attacking

Enemies can be attacked by walking towards them or clicking them when standing on a nearby tile.

### Interaction

Interaction happens with **_E_**-key. So far the only interactable object is the portal to change zone.

## Roadmap

Quite a bit of work to do for the "engine" before an actual game can be made. Some ideas in an order of rough importance:

* Pop-up messages to show relevant tips for player, for example prompt to press a button to perform certain action like changing zone.
* Major refactoring of map generating to allow for different types of maps like dungeons, outdoors and what not.
* Saving the current game state to local storage and perhaps to cloud too.
* A quest system with quest givers, objectives and log.
* Experience system and more advanced character stats.
* System for items and gear.
* Field of vision with fog of war.
